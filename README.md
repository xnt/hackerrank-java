# hackerrank-java

It's been a while since the last time I really took on into programming challenges, or Java, but it's always a good time to be back!

This repo contains my Java answers to some HackerRank challenges. Although I'm choosing Java 8 as the language, my memory is super fuzzy regarding what's on 7, 8 or 9. So chances are most of this code looks like Java 6 :joy:.

Anyway, enjoy!
